# Molly Insider

`Molly Insider` is the standalone app with which the Molly community tests new features that will eventually be integrated into stable [`Molly`](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android).

`Molly Insider` is built with the most recent code changes and is not fully tested, so expect some occasional bugs or breaks.

## Side-by-side install

You can install `Molly Insider` next to the [stable `Molly` app](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android), allowing you to use both independently from each other.

Note that `Molly Insider` connects to Signal's staging servers only, therefore you *cannot* use it to message your normal Signal contacts.
